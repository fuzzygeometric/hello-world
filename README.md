# hello-world
A place where danielle Gauthier stores ideas and resources to share and discuss with others

I am an Integrated Media Artist at Hunter College approaching my Masters thesis with coded poetry and thermodynamic practice as a nonduality yoga practitioner.
I use conformal science to apply healing cybernetics and data practice like yoga and programming.
I use a sound color synesthesia to categorize frameworks for a comfortable baseline based in sound and color technology awareness. 

I want to address questions of access to different learning languages for community to grow comfortably in with my work. I need to make a pull request but havent made a diff yet. Had to be extra so you know the kind of way we could relate. It's 22:30 on a Tuesday. and i hate capitalizing
