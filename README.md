#About Me
I am an Integrated Media Artist at Hunter College approaching my Masters thesis with coded poetry and thermodynamic practice as a nonduality yoga practitioner, [based in ashtanga](https://www.arlingtoncenter.org/Sanskrit-English.pdf).
I use [conformal science](https://jila.colorado.edu/~ajsh/insidebh/penrose.html) to apply healing correlations and data practice like yoga and programming.
I use a [sound color synesthesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromesthesia) to categorize frameworks for a comfortable nondual baseline based in sound and color technology awareness I call a Matrice.

I want to address questions of access to different learning languages for community to grow comfortably in with my work.
