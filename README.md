### About Me
I am an Integrated Media Artist at Hunter College approaching my Masters thesis in Cybernetics. I use a matrix of coded poetry to quantify my baseline using the laws of thermodynamics, with heat, work, temperature, and energy. 

The first law says energy can transform, but is never created nor destroyed; so I try to conserve what I create and make renewing and reproducible products using concrete poetry. In a collision without matter change, like a casual meet, the change in internal energy of a thermodynamic system is equal to the energy gained as heat minus the thermodynamic work done by the system on its surroundings. We receive in comparison to what we offer. 

The second law says temperature in an isolated system is always cooling. Heat does not spontaneously flow from a colder body to a hotter body. Heat gives and cold takes. Isolation is drain and we are social beings who take.

The third law says a temperature approaches a constant as absolute zero. As the temperature of a system approaches absolute zero, all processes cease and the entropy of the system approaches a minimum value. We need to give heat and make a profit in order to function.

I am a nonduality yoga practitioner relating Haitian spirituality with thermodynamics to advaita vedanta. My practice is [based in ashtanga](https://www.arlingtoncenter.org/Sanskrit-English.pdf).

I use physical references as geometric or meditative angles to connect different contexts, a [conformal science](https://jila.colorado.edu/~ajsh/insidebh/penrose.html) to apply healing correlations and data practice with yoga and programming.

Entropy is the resistance from potential for work. I use a [sound color synesthesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromesthesia) to categorize frameworks for a comfortable nondual baseline respective of resistance based in sound and color technology awareness I call a Matrice. To use it, simply identify what is known to fill the parameters, then consider what is revealed by the categories of what was not named present. This geometric exercise helps to balance a space by drawing in elements of what defines a baseline when it is not present.
