### About Me
I am an Integrated Media Artist at Hunter College approaching my Masters thesis in Cybernetics, the art and science of systems of control and communication in living beings and machines. I use a matrix of coded poetry to quantify a baseline using the laws of thermodynamics, with heat, work, temperature, and energy. 

### Thermodynamic Baseline
The first law says energy can transform, but is never created nor destroyed; so I try to conserve what I create and make renewing and reproducible products using concrete poetry. In a collision without matter change, like a casual meet, the change in internal energy of a thermodynamic system is equal to the energy gained as heat minus the thermodynamic work done by the system on its surroundings. We receive in comparison to what we offer. 

The second law says temperature in an isolated system is always cooling. Heat does not spontaneously flow from a colder body to a hotter body. Heat gives and cold takes. Isolation is drain and we are social beings who take.

The third law says a temperature approaches a constant as absolute zero. As the temperature of a system approaches absolute zero, all processes cease and the entropy of the system approaches a minimum value. We need to give heat and make a profit in order to function.

### Cybernetics
My work considers place and intersection in meditative scores on change. I study how constance occurs and how we interact to resist it or move with it. I study null work  for recreation. It is partial to circumstance but makes no change, like being accepted. I reinterpret its balanced isolation as micromovements that make a matrix of 16 particles to be able to define the boundaries of any space with a score that expands it to a given baseline. 

Entropy is the resistance from potential for work. I use [sound and color in a synesthesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromesthesia) to read for a framework at a comfortable and dynamic or nondual baseline. I call it la matrice. To use it, I simply identify what is known to fill the parameters, then consider what is revealed by the remaining categories of what was not named present. This geometric exercise helps to balance a space by drawing in elements of what defines a baseline when it is not present.

This puts me in a position that I can give space by taking it, as well as being able to share with others that perspective. Self advocacy becomes a social act. Examples include my geometric drawing workshops where I lead the documentation of a thought with representative shapes and lines to readdress it with new visual cues. My matrix, la matrice, can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mX2m7MB7L4baMGf4qT60YFSeOO11gX3twezpTky50IY/edit?usp=sharing).

To use the matrix, allow associations to flow as you read or consider it. I incorporated socio-economic meanings to make more immediate building blocks for discussion of a shared worldview of self quantification around the matrix.

### Sources
I am a nonduality yoga practitioner relating Haitian spirituality with thermodynamics to advaita vedanta. My practice is [based in ashtanga](https://www.arlingtoncenter.org/Sanskrit-English.pdf) but I use my childhood study of dance and Dominican family culture of dance, along with other energetic practices like eating, to practice echofer, or a thermodynamic heating ritual to heal. I believe our experience can never be captured and must be constantly expressed and drawn out.

I use physical references as geometric or meditative angles to connect different contexts, a [conformal science](https://jila.colorado.edu/~ajsh/insidebh/penrose.html) to apply healing correlations and data practice with yoga and programming. When I feel attached to a concept or object, I practice nonattachment in line with ashtanga yoga principles, which helps me arrive at better understanding of the attached figure so I can change my association.
